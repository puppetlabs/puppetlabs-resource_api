## Module Description

This module installs the Puppet Resource API gem into a puppet agent and pe-pupetserver or puppetserver service. This is necessary to use any type or provider that is implemented using the Puppet Resource API.

## Setup

### What resource_api affects

The Puppet Resource API gem will be installed into a puppet agent using the `puppet_gem` provider, and into a puppetserver service using the `puppetserver_gem` provider. To activate the gem, a reload of the puppetserver service is necessary. In most cases, this should happen automatically and cause little to no interruption to service.

### Setup Requirements

The Puppet Resource API is only compatible with Puppet 4.7 and later.
There are no further specific requirements.

### Beginning with resource_api

To install dependencies of the Puppet Resource API:

1. Classify or apply the `resource_api` class on each master (master of masters, and if present, compile masters and replica master) that needs to process Puppet Resource API types and providers.
1. Classify or apply the `resource_api` class on each puppet agent that needs to apply Puppet Resource API types and providers.

To specify the version of the Puppet Resource API gem to be installed, instead use the `resource_api::install::agent` class and its `$api_version` parameter.

To specify a non-default `puppetserver` service resource (if you're not using the standard service) instead use the `resource_api::install::master` class and its `$puppetserver_service` parameter.

Run `puppet agent -t` on the master(s) before using the Puppet Resource API on the agent(s).
